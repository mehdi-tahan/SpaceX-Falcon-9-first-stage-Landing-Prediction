# SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction

## The goal is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 

Falcon 9 became the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload into orbit.

Typical missions include launches of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, The heaviest payloads launched on Falcon are batches of 24 Starlink V2-Mini satellites weighing 17,500 kg 

This reusability results in significantly reduced launch costs, as the cost of the first stage constitutes the majority of the cost of a new rocket.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Therefore we determine if the first stage will land successfully, we can predict the cost of a launch.

This information can be used for " Space Y " company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

In this lab, we collected the data in the correct format from an Space X API.
