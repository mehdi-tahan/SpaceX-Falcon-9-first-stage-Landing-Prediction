# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction

## The goal is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore we determine if the first stage will land, we can predict the cost of a launch. This information can be used for " Space Y " company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
In this lab, we collected the data in the correct format from an Space X API.
